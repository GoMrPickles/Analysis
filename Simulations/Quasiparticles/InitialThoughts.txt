Rothwarf Taylor Equations
Discretize energy states, add coupling between different energy levels
Use N as #particles/Volume/Energy (in this case, you would multiply by deltaE or the energy discretization and multiply by unit volume to get a real number of particles).

Need timesscale: tau-qp relax (emit phonon)
tau-B (pair breaking time)
tau-esc (escape time for phonons into substrate)
